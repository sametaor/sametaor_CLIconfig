# Installing BlackHole 2ch

CAVA requires an audio source to visualize. On macOS, you can use **BlackHole** as a virtual audio device to route system audio.

## Steps

1. Download BlackHole 2ch from [Existential Audio](https://existential.audio/blackhole/)
2. Install the `.pkg` file and restart your Mac
3. Open **Audio MIDI Setup** (Applications → Utilities)
4. Create a Multi-Output Device that includes BlackHole 2ch
5. Set it as your default output device
6. Configure CAVA to use BlackHole 2ch as the audio source in your config

For detailed setup, refer to the [CAVA GitHub README](https://github.com/karlstav/cava)
