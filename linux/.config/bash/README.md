# Things to take into account:-


I tried countless times on bringing about the feature parity of the vi-mode segment to be usable in bash, be it via ble.sh or be it via bash-preexec, or be it even vibe-coding it all, but it does not seem to function, however, the functions themselves are usable, so hope you can live with that ðŸ˜¢ (personally preferred zsh for this reason).
